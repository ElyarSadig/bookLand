### Usage & Deployment

To deploy our system locally using Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Clone Repositories**: Clone all the service repositories from GitHub to your local machine. Ensure that you have Git installed and configured.
   
2. **Install Docker**: If you haven't already, install Docker on your system. You can download and install Docker Desktop from the official [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

3. **Create Docker Network**: Create a Docker network to enable communication between the services. Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    docker network create my_network
    ```

    This command will create a Docker network named `my_network`.

4. **Compose Services**: Navigate to each service directory and use Docker Compose to bring up the services. Run the following command in each service directory:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    This command will start the service containers in detached mode, allowing them to run in the background.

5. **Verify Deployment**: Once all services are up and running, you can verify the deployment by accessing the respective endpoints or by interacting with the system through the provided interfaces.
